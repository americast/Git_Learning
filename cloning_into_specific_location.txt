The example I think a lot of people asking this question are after is this.
 If you are in the directory you want the contents of the git repository dumped to, run:

git clone git@github.com:whatever .
The "." at the end specifies the current folder as the checkout folder.


go into folder.. if folder is empty, then

git clone git@github.com:whatever .
else

git init
git remote add origin PATH/TO/REPO
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
